# sillytext
## What it does:
Takes the text given by the user and adds emojis to every word, thus making it silly!
For example: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away" becomes "An 🏌️‍♂️ apple 🍎 a 🍷 day 🎂 keeps ⛹🏾‍♀️ the 🫵🏻 doctor 🕗 away 💨"

## How to use it:
Simply enter your text into the text box and receive the "silly-ified" text :D

Emojis are usually based off the word. If the word cannot be attributed to an emoji, a random emoji is chosen.
